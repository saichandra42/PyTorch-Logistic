# PyTorch-Logistic
Logistic regression implementation with optimization in AWS Sagemaker.

-[]  Create initial model for PyTorch Linear Regression
-[]  Model training/testing error difference is huge, is the model overfitting?
-[]  Did the model overfit for 1 training example? Sanity check
-[]  Tensorboard API to create versions of the models.
-[]  Clean up the code and use parallel processing to fasten the training process
-[]  Overfitting/underfitting issue.
